  The two players decide in advance how many games they will play, which must be an even number. One player becomes the codemaker, the other the codebreaker. The codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs.
   Duplicates and blanks are allowed depending on player choice, so the player could even choose four code pegs of the same color or four blanks.
   In the instance that blanks are not elected to be a part of the game, the codebreaker may not use blanks in order to establish the final code. The chosen pattern
   is placed in the four holes covered by the shield, visible to the codemaker but not to the codebreaker
